## Overview

#### What is this homework?

Today we're going to work with some starter code that pulls from an API and refactor it!

**The objective of this homework is to:**

* Refactor this starter code to practice working with API calls.
* Familiarize yourself with the React component lifecycle.

#### Your tasks to complete this homework are as follows:

1) Two of your quadrants must pull API data from two different sources and display API data in some fashion in each. [Here are some example APIs for you to choose from.](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) 

2) One quadrant must have a [Kawaii](https://react-kawaii.now.sh/) of your choice in it. The Kawaii will be sad until BOTH API calls have been made, and then it will be happy!

3) One quadrant will have a button to fetch API calls again.

** Good luck and have fun! **
